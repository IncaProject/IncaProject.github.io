Inca 2.2:  November 1, 2007
  
  * Added customizable navigation bar to the consumer web pages 

  * Added the ability to graph exit status/comparitor status history and
    error message frequency for one or more series

  * Added a new summary status view using the Google Maps API available
    from the consumer tab "map of sampleSuite results" under "CURRENT DATA".

  * Revised consumer documentation in user guide

  * Changed reporter manager credential creation process so that instead of
    being generated by the agent and transmitted to the reporter manager,
    a key and certificate request are created by the reporter manager.  The
    certificate request is then fetched by the agent which generates a 
    certificate and transmits it to the reporter manager.  The directions
    for the manual reporter manager have also been modified accordingly.

  * XML and XSL files for the consumer have been moved from etc to 
    webapps/xml and webapps/xsl respectively.  The war files have moved
    from webapps to webapps/war.

    constraints to generated certificates

    differentiate values with spaces from multi-valued macros.

    to set the max heap size when starting up with the Java components

    file and in some cases disrupting reporter manager restarts
