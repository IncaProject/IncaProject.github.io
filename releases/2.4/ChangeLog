Inca 2.4: July 3, 2008

  * Rewrote Inca consumer and ported it to Jetty 6.  A new REPORTS menu was
    added with pages for displaying historical summary data (see Section 6.2
    in the user guide for more details).  A new QUERY menu was added to graph
    series history, add custom queries, and query the depot (see Section 6.3
    in the userguide for more details).  An HTTPS server is now started by
    default to protect access the later 2 items in the QUERY menu.  

  * Added python Reporter API classes and reporters cluster.admin.dir.usage,
    cluster.admin.posixps.unit, cluster.devel.gmake.version, and
    cluster.uptime.performance.

  * Modified incat to prompt for a resource in response to the "Run Now ..."
    button; the series will only be run on the selected resource.

  * Added filtering capability in depot that enables incoming reports to be
    modified before being stored into the db.  The primary motivation for
    this feature is to differentiate errors that occur during a scheduled 
    downtimes from regular errors.  Further details are provided in the user
    guide under "Report Filtering".

  * Changed repository refresh in incat to an asynchronous action so control
    is returned to the user more quickly

  * Added support for -X switch to incpack.

  * Enabled macro use in cron schedule, limits, and acceptable output expr

  * Upgraded j2ssh libraries on the agent to 1.2.9

  * Added cluster.batch.wrapper for executing reporters thru a batch queue
    and documentation for how to configure it in incat.

  * Added additional reporters: 
      cluster.admin.dir.usage
      data.transfer.gridftp.unit.copy-dns
      data.transfer.gridftp.unit.auth-dns
      summary.successpct.performance

  * Fixed bug that caused report bodies to include cwd at print time, rather
    than at reporter creation time.
  
  * Fix to Reporter.pm's loggedCommand method--wasn't killing spawned processes

  * Fixed bug in Globus access method where HOME was not getting properly
    resolved

  * Reviewed, corrected, and made consistent all reporters' use of the
    loggedCommand method.  About 65 reporters were changed and their versions
    incremented.

Inca 2.3:  February 11, 2008
  
  * Add support for customizing notifiers via a script

  * Added ability to query histories by resource group nickname
    and series nickname rather than configID
  
  * Added ability to generate summary reports for groups of reporter series

  * Increased size of reporter error message from 256 to 4000 characters

  * Added check boxes to select columns and rows in graph.xsl

  * Improved display of error distribution graph

  * Fixed bug on some architectures with no reports being produced from
    reporter manager when executing reporters with proxies.

  * Took out usage from error message when reports are timed out so that
    reports can be grouped. 

  * Improved working and appearance of incat's macro dialog

  * Fixed bug that prevented find from working in the report list of incat's
    series dialog

  * Changed the way list values w/in repository catalog Packages.gz are
    notated.  This has the effect of allowing ; to appear in the default
    values of reporter arguments.  The Inca software is backward-compatible,
    so no changes to existing catalogs are required.  Incpack script
    updated.

  * Performance improvements to Depot query responses

  * Trim debugging output from Depot log
  
  * Changed email notifications to send only if result is different even when
    other series params change

  * Fixed bug where '-' was not allowed in reporter argument names.

  * Fixed bug where ?-x was not being recognized as valid field in the cron
    string, i.e., equivalent to ?-x/1

  * Fallback to use ip address if unable to get a FQDN for the agent (for
    reporter managers to use to contact the agent).

  * Fixed incat find feature in "Add series" window.

  * Fixed incat bug where hitting cancel after the File->open menu cleared
    the current configuration

  * Fixed bug that was intepreting ~ in the reporter manager install path
    as part of the directory name rather than the home directory

  * Added reporter descriptions to list_reporters.cgi output

  * Depot and xsl stylesheet changes to better display stale reports (stale
    reports are marked with an asterisk by default.xsl and swStack.xsl)

  * Fixed bug in stylesheets for matching similarly named resources

  * Added a restart command to the inca script

  * Added a prompt for password verification in createauth command

  * Added a patch to Schedule::Cron module that addresses problems with the
    scheduler on forward DST changes.  Can be upgraded utilizing the -u and -U
    flags on the agent.

  * Added new reporters: 
         cluster.rm.ps.unit

Inca 2.2:  November 1, 2007

  * Added customizable navigation bar to the consumer web pages 

  * Added the ability to graph exit status/comparitor status history and
    error message frequency for one or more series

  * Added a new summary status view using the Google Maps API available
    from the consumer tab "map of sampleSuite results" under "CURRENT DATA".

  * Revised consumer documentation in user guide

  * Changed reporter manager credential creation process so that instead of
    being generated by the agent and transmitted to the reporter manager,
    a key and certificate request are created by the reporter manager.  The
    certificate request is then fetched by the agent which generates a 
    certificate and transmits it to the reporter manager.  The directions
    for the manual reporter manager have also been modified accordingly.

  * XML and XSL files for the consumer have been moved from etc to 
    webapps/xml and webapps/xsl respectively.  The war files have moved
    from webapps to webapps/war.

    differentiate values with spaces from multi-valued macros.

  * Enhanced bin/inca script to use environment variable $INCA_MEMORY
    to set the max heap size when starting up with the Java components

  * Fixed bug which was causing "Unexpected reply" messages in the agent.log
    file and in some cases disrupting reporter manager restarts

    already included.  There is also a way to customize the text that
    gets sent in the message in etc/manualEmail.txt
